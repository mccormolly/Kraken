# Kraken

## Overview
Welcome to the Kraken! 

Contained here are all files we had to author in order to operate the Kraken for our purpose. Kraken/Jubilee assembly and operation information can be found at on the [Jubilee Wiki](https://jubilee3d.com/index.php?title=Main_Page). 

## Folder structure
We connect to the Kraken through a hardwired wifi router. All code is uploaded directly to the robot through the computer terminal, and all operation is performed through terminal. 

Important note: machine interface needs to be on every level.
